description: You’ve uncovered a hidden web portal that provides read-only access to server log files nothing else. Your mission is to find a way to leverage this log interface to extract the system’s confidential data (i.e., the secret flag). Think creatively, bypass its limitations, and prove you can retrieve the hidden information. Good luck!

# The extra field provides additional fields for data during the install/sync commands/
# Fields in extra can be used to supply additional information for other challenge types
# For example the follow extra field is for dynamic challenges. To use these following
# extra fields, set the type to "dynamic" and uncomment the "extra" section below
# extra:
#     initial: 500
#     decay: 100
#     minimum: 50

# # Settings used for Dockerfile deployment
# # If not used, remove or set to null
# # If you have a Dockerfile set to .
# # If you have an imaged hosted on Docker set to the image url (e.g. python/3.8:latest, registry.gitlab.com/python/3.8:latest)
# # Follow Docker best practices and assign a tag
# image: .

# Specify a protocol that should be used to connect to the running image
# For example if the image is a website you can specify http or https
# Otherwise you can specify tcp
protocol: http

# Specify a host to deploy the challenge onto.
# The currently supported URI schemes are ssh:// and registry://
# ssh is an ssh URI where the above image will be copied to and deployed (e.g. ssh://root@123.123.123.123)
# registry is a Docker registry tag (e.g registry://registry.example.com/test/image)
# host can also be specified during the deploy process: `ctf challenge deploy challenge --host=ssh://root@123.123.123.123`
host: null

# Optional settings

# connection_info is used to provide a link, hostname, or instructions on how to connect to a challenge
connection_info: http://localhost:5000

# healthcheck is a tool/script used to check a challenge
# If connection_info was provided to CTFd when the challenge was installed, it will be passed to the healthcheck script:
# ./writeup/exploit.sh --connection-info "nc hostname 12345"
#healthcheck: writeup/exploit.py

# solved before being available.
# Can be removed if unused
# Accepts challenge names as strings or challenge IDs as integers
# requirements:
#     - "Warmup"
#     - "Are you alive"

# The following format for requirements can also be used. This format can also
